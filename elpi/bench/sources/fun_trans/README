Example fun_trans-1.0-0  is from 
www.ai.univie.ac.at/~markus/home/publications.html#mscthesis

  It contains code used in the MSc thesis of Markus Mottl.  Haven't
had time to study it very carefully.  It does program transformations.
It uses both second and third order constructs (see modules
let_ext.mod and tp_let_ext.mod).  It is non-Llambda and uses both
first order unification (for type inference) and higher order
unification (see below).

To run tests, do as in:

./main tests/poly.dat

poly.dat can be replaced by any other file name in the tests subdirectory.

Run all tests with

./testscript
