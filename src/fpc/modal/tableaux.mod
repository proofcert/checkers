% mv: in this version, we do not store relational atoms with a proper label

%  Idea: add a constructor
% type relind index -> index -> index.
%  where the two indexes refer to the formulas that introduced the two worlds

% The way it works is that the decide tree tells us the index of the formula to decide on but does not change the tree
% It is followed by a connective or initial rule, where we actually change the tree and update the index of the sub formulas
% Then we store it using the updated index
